(a)

Assumptions of anova
Independence of cases - this is an assumption of the model that simplifies the statistical analysis.
Normality - the distributions of the residuals are normal.
Equality -(or "homogeneity") of variances.

(b)

The one-way analysis of variance is used to determine whether there are any statistically significant differences 
between the means of two or more independent groups.
